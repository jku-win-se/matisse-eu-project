# Overview

This repository contains additional material related to Task 2.1 of the project. This task focuses on conducting a systematic study, specifically a Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) of both published scientific systematic studies and grey literature. The purpose of this study is to explore the combination of Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) and Digital Twin Engineering (DTE), with a particular emphasis on traceability and federation concerns.

## Introduction

In the contemporary technological innovation landscape, digital transformation is progressively reshaping various industries. Among the frontiers of this revolution, Digital Twin (DT) stands out as a pivotal concept. A DT is a virtual representation of a real system that interacts with its environment. DTs can be built for different purposes, such as for the design, development, analysis, simulation, and operations of non-fully digital systems.

Digital Twin Engineering (DTE) involves the creation of a virtual replica of a physical asset, system, or process, enabling real-time monitoring, analysis, and optimization. This concept has garnered substantial attention across multiple sectors due to its potential to enhance operational efficiency, predict maintenance, and improve decision-making processes.

Model-Driven Engineering (MDE) is an engineering methodology that relies on models as purposeful abstractions of complex systems. These models are machine-readable artefacts that can be manipulated throughout the system's life cycle. MDE includes core concepts such as models, metamodels, and model transformations, offering a body of knowledge (BoK) that aims at the highest possible automation and productivity of the engineering process and quality of the engineered system [Burgue√±o et al., 2019].

The synergy between DTE and MDE could present a compelling paradigm for handling the complexity of DTs. MDE, with its focus on abstraction, automation, and the use of machine-readable, prescriptive models to drive DTE development, can significantly streamline the creation, management, and evolution of DTs.

## Purpose of the Review

This Multivocal Literature Review (MLR) aims to provide a structured overview of the current research landscape concerning the use of MDE for DTE. Through this review, following the guidelines by Kitchenham and Charters (2007), we seek to determine whether and how MDE supports DTE, particularly whether federation and traceability concerns have been considered and eventually addressed with MDE techniques and practices.

## Methodology

From an initial set of potentially relevant 373 peer-reviewed publications and 236 grey literature sources, we selected 22 literature studies, which were analyzed according to a meticulous data extraction, analysis, and synthesis process (Garousi et al., 2019; Wohlin, 2014; Ali & Petersen, 2014).
